And now I see just how much power there is in the world seeing me, this Black kid from the south who came from parents from humble beginnings, as the one inspiring them.

It feels like breathing.\u201d \ud83e\udd0e\ud83c\udfe0 \u2063\n \u2063\nWelcome to the home of @skylarmarshai (Skylar Marshai) and @tolutemi (Temi Ibisanmi). The globe-trotting couple are known for documenting their epic adventures together \u2014 from her roots in Barbados to his native country of Nigeria, and over a dozen countries in between. They\u2019re an unstoppable force, and though they discover elements of home in every corner of the world they visit, their favorite place is in the foundation of the home they\u2019re building with each other. \u2063\n \u2063\n\u201cWe always felt like home to each other, so creating a home with one another just made sense,\u201d says Temi. \u201cMy happily-ever-after looks like yesterday and every day like it.\u201d \u2063\n \u2063\nSkylar agrees. \u201cMy happily-ever-after looks like this. Period.\u201d \u2063\n \u2063\nThis month, we\u2019re celebrating Black history through our favorite love stories \u2728 #ShareBlackLove",

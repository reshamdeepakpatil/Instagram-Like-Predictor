            "description": "Norman Lear. \ud83d\udc94 His shows shaped my childhood and getting to know him was one of my greatest honors. He made such a difference. A huge impact on television and humanity. He was able to tackle and discuss heated political conversations during difficult and charged times and we were able to laugh and learn. I yearn for those days. When creativity was a learning tool and could inspire people to maybe think just a little bit differently. And of course to laugh. Our greatest source of healing. \nHe was the kindest and gentlest man. When you were in his presence, you were the only one in the room. He made everyone feel this. Even when someone believed differently than him. That\u2019s what made life and people interesting to him. To have discussions and really take in how people felt and hear their point of view. He knew how to give voice to all sides and somehow in the process bring people closer together. May we take a page from Norman\u2019s playbook as a way of honoring his life. An extraordinary life. \n\nRest in peace Norman. It was a gift to stand in your light. \n\ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

We all experience loss at some point in our lives. Loss of life or loss of love. Being able to really SIT in this grief allows you to feel the moments of joy and gratitude for having loved someone that deep. And we loved him deeply. He was such a part of our DNA. We were always the 6 of us. This was a chosen family that forever changed the course of who we were and what our path was going to be. For Matty, he KNEW he loved to make people laugh. As he said himself, if he didn't hear the \u2018laugh\u2019 he thought he was going to die. His life literally depended on it. And boy did he succeed in doing just that. He made all of us laugh. And laugh hard. In the last couple weeks, I\u2019ve been poring over our texts to one another. Laughing and crying then laughing again. I\u2019ll keep them forever and ever. I found one text that he sent me out of nowhere one day. It says it all. (See the second slide\u2026) \n\nMatty, I love you so much and I know you are now completely at peace and out of any pain. I talk to you every day\u2026 sometimes I can almost hear you saying \u201ccould you BE any crazier?\u201d \n\nRest little brother. \nYou always made my day\u2026 \n\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f",
